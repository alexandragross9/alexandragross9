# Capstone Project: Providing Data-Driven Suggestions for HR
<hr>
In this project, we perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and construct a Predictive Model in Python on mock HR data from Salifort Motors. 
<br>
<br>
In the final project of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate, I evaluated "Salifort Motors" a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer. Salifort has a global workforce of over 100,000 employees who design electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-based vehicles. Salifortâ€™s end-to-end vertical integration model has made it a global leader at the intersection of alternative energy and automobiles.
<br>
<br>
However, Salifort faces a high employee turnover rate. It is time consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees. I was tasked with analyzing the data and building a predition model to identify turnover risk and furthermore suggest new policies to HR that would increase employee retention.

<br>

### Questions To Be Explored
<hr>
1. What variables contribute most to employee turnover?<br>
2. What key insights and trends emerged from EDA? <br>
3. What potential recommendations should be made to management? <br>
4. What ethical considerations should be noted throughout the process? <br>
